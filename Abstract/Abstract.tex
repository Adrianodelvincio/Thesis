The Mainz Radius Experiment (MREX) is an experimental campaign with the aim of determining fundamental properties of the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. The equation of state is the fundamental quantity that contains all the thermodynamic properties of a system of nucleons and describes the relation between the quantities as energy, pressure, temperature, density and the asymmetry between the number of neutron and the number of proton in nuclear-matter.
 An important parameter, poorly-known at the state of current knowledge, is the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation density $L$, which quantifies the dependencies of the energy per nucleon associated with the changes in neutron-proton asymmetry. This key component controls how the energy of a system of nucleons change whether there is a difference in the number of proton and neutrons and it is also an underlying contribution to the determination of neutron stars radius whose physical description, despite being many order of magnitude higher than the physical dimensions of the nuclei, is still determined by the EOS, too.
The slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is strongly correlated to a characteristic shown by heavy nuclei, the neutron-skin thickness, that is the difference between the  spacial distribution radius $R$ of the neutrons and protons. Nowadays it is well-known from various nuclear physics experiment that the neutrons of a nucleus tends to locate more externally, forming a neutral thin layer around atomic nuclei. The experimental measurement of the neutron-skin thickness it is the main method to derive the value of $L$.  
The MREX is focused on the determination of the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}Pb$ from parity-violating experiments (PV) performed at the future MESA electron accelerator, that is currently under construction and will be located in Mainz. The parity-violating experiments, where longitudinal polarized electrons scatter from a fixed target at a single value of momentum transfer, consist on the determination of the asymmetry $A_{p}$ in the number of scattered electrons due to the different polarization of the beam,  and are valid probe to determine the neutron-skin thickness of heavy-nuclei. 
In this context, it is necessary to determine one of the possible background sources for the PV experiments, known as beam normal single spin asymmetry, or transverse asymmetry, which consists in a small transverse electron polarization component which produce an effect that is of the same order of magnitude of the desired.
The work of this thesis focuses on the measurement of the transverse asymmetry $A_{n}$ carried out at the Mainz microtron accelerator (MAMI) on a $^{12}C$ target. The $^{12}C$ target is particularly suited for studying and testing the electronic systems and detectors that will be employed in the next phase of the MREX experiment, the determination of $A_{n}$ for $^{208}Pb$. 
The \transv has been measured for electron-$^{12}C$ at a fixed angle, corresponding to a transfer momentum of $Q^{2} = \SI{0.04}{\giga \electronvolt}$.

\chapter*{Organization of Contents}

the work-flow of my thesis can be summarized in a first part (corresponding to chapter 1 and chapter 2) which describes in details the underlying physics and the motivation for the measurement of the PV scattering and $A_{n}$, and a second part focused on the hardware work and data-analysis which is summarized in the following step:
\begin{itemize}
\item Description of MAMI experimental setup and beam characteristics. Explanation of beam measurement equipment and the interface with the electronics developed for the MREX experiment.
\item Description and characterization of the detectors with test in the laboratory.
\item Electronic tests and characterization. 
\item Development of the analysis program, check of the program with simple monte-carlo simulation together with specific unit test.
\item Description of the calibration phase, data pre-selection and removal of the outliers.
\item Data-analysis for $^{12}C$ and extraction of the $A_{n}$. Raw estimation of the systematic effects of the measurement and determination of the rates with the lead target, in prevision of the future experiment with $^{208}Pb$.
\end{itemize}

The result obtained are discussed and compared with the other measurements performed by different collaborations. Finally the confront with the theoretical prediction discussed in chapter 2 is done.
