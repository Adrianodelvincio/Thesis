\begin{itemize}
\item explain neutron skin thickness.
\item connection to neutron stars radious, and neutron stars description.
\item Equation of state (EoS) for high density nuclear matter.
\item Parity-violating scattering experiment for extracting neutron skin thickness.
\item mention the weak form factor.
\item Transverse asymmetry as background for Parity-violating experiment. 
\item Mention the other experiment, like PREX, that measure zero $A_{n}$ for Lead.
